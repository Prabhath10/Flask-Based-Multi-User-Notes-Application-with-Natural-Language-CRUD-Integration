# Flask-Based-Multi-User-Notes-Application-with-Natural-Language-CRUD-Integration
This project is a Flask-based multi-user notes app using SQLite for data storage. It allows users to register, log in, and manage notes through a web interface or natural language commands. It supports rule-based NLP and optional LLM integration (like LLaMA or Ollama) for intelligent, AI-driven CRUD operations.
